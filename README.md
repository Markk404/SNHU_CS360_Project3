•	Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The requirement of the application states it must be able to store an editable chart of inventory items, have a messaging system to allow contact to other users, and a login. These components are use a database to store information. 
•	What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
The necessary screens for this application would be the messaging screens, the login screen, and the inventory activity screens. They were designed to be minimalistic to reduce confusion and increase user friendliness. Buttons additionally have labels and icons that denote their purpose easily. My designs were successful because I based them off of designs I have seen in the past and research done. In addition, adding more items means more work for the developer; me.
•	How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
First, I started out by thinking how the application should work, what pages it needed, and so on. The I created the UI in android studio. Afterwards I began researching functions and other syntax to be able to put together a main project. The hardest part was getting the darn thing to use databases and setting them up. 
•	How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
I tested my app to be functional by running it in emulators and environments.  The testing process is highly important to work out bugs. It was very important to me because I found a lot of bugs. Buttons that didn’t work, buttons that started the wrong procedure, wrong images, old placeholders still being used, etc…
•	Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
Since this project was my first experience with Android app development, challenges arose around every step and moment of the process. From the beginning I had a clear image of what the product should look like, and the development of the app was molded around that idea. And from the beginning, I had to google how to do everything.
•	In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I believe I showed my skill in the creation of an effective UI. Aside from that, I am somewhat surprised myself that I got the application working by some miracle. It was very stressful. Still, it provided a unique experience and challenge to allow me grow my existing skillsets.
